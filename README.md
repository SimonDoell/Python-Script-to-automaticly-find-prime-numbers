This is a small python project that i just felt like doing :). You can search prime numbers with it and you can customise it a lot!
Here is the explenaiton:
  
  -Fast mode:
    When searching for prime numbers, when the programm detects, that the number is devidable by some number, it skips the progress and only shows this       
    particular number. Is useful for actually searching for prime numbers, but still having some information about the number. Set to True, if you want 
    it to skip when finding a number.
    
  -Do you want all numbers to be shown:
    If you want ONLY the prime numbers to be shown the set this to False. This will automaticly set Fast mode to True, because it performs better and you
    will not see any number that isn't a prime number.

  -From which number to start?:
    This set's the range in which the programm trys to find prime numbers. Please enter an odd number here, it is actually essential for it to work.

  -Up to which number do you want to execute the programm?:
    This number set's the upper range limit of how high it goes.

  -How long do you want the delay between each iteration to be?:
    Defines the time to wait between each new number to be checked, if it is a prime number. 0 is as fast as your computer can go. You can do floats like 0.3 
    too! But variables like 2 are fine too. 
    
After all that the programm will tell you, how long it will take for all of the numbers in your defined range to be checked. When the time is set to 0, it will not tell how long it will take.


Here are some presets, that you can use for hunting prime numbers:
  -Fast mode: False
  -All numbers be shown?: True
  -Starting number: 1
  -Ending number: 1000
  -Time pausing: 0.1
--> this set will tell you every bit of information about all numbers between 1 and 1000.
  --> ranges can be played with as well as the pause time; it is just for demonstration


Another preset:
  -Fast mode: True
  -All numbers shown: False
  -Starting number: 1
  -Ending number: 1000
  -Time pausing: 0
--> this preset is useful for ONLY getting the prime numbers between 1 and 1000. It is as fast as possible, etc.
  --> of course you can change the range if you want, or if all numbers are shown




Enjoy this little programm I spend way too much time on, than I want to admitt.
Play with the values and try out stuff, thats the way to learn!
